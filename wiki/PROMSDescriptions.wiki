#summary PROMS Documentation

= Introduction =

This document will explain how the microcode will be stored in PROMS


= Details =

In order to maintain the circuitry regarding the Control part simpler M1 uses the microcode stored in PROMS in this way you gain more flexibility. M1 uses 5 Proms(U1,U2,U3,U4,U5) chips forming a 40 bit microinstruction.

Taking a look to the schematic we can easily observe each prom forming the control signals to be decoded.
