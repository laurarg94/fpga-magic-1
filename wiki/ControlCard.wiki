= Introduction =

This card includes the Control part of Magic-1 it fetches and decodes each instruction to generate signals to control the data path.


= Details =

This card includes the following  parts

|| *Part* || *Description* ||
|| Microcode || It uses the magic-1 opcodes to fetch the microinstruction data from Proms ||
|| Field Decode || Prepare signals delivered from Microcode || 
|| Faults and Interrupts || Stores Interrupt, Fault bits and Encoder signal marshalled to Microcode ||

== Microcode ==

This part will use the following signals:
  * IR
  * ENCODER    
  * Next

As indexes for PROM microinstruction area, so after fetching each microinstruction it will create the 40 bit signals needed for controlling magic-1
