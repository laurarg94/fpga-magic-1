= Introduction =

The Magic-1 Faults and Interrupts card uses the CI 74F148 (Priority Encoder) to mask prioritize interrupts.

For example a 4-bit priority encoder basically convert a 4-bit input into a binary representation. If the input n is active, all lower inputs (n-1 .. 0) are ignored (Less priority):

Example: x(inputs), y(outputs), X(Don't care)

||x3||x2||x1||x0||y1||y0||
||1||X||X||X||1||1||
||0||1||X||X||1||0||
||0||0||1||X||0||1||
||0||0||0||X||0||0||

Note that if the input bit x3 is '1' the output will be (1,1) even if all others inputs changes. then x3 has the most priority level.
