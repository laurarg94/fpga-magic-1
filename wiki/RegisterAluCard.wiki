= Introduction =

The register and Alu card includes most of the datapath of Magic-1, who receives control signals from Control card in order to execute each microinstruction of Magic-1 programs.


= Details =

This card will be described and will include the following parts:
  * ALU
  * General Registers
    # Register A
    # Register B
    # Register C
    # Register DP
    # Register SP
    # Register SSP
    # Register PC
    # Register TPC
  * MDR
  * MSW
  * Special Registers
    # Register MAR

==ALU==
The ALU will handle all logic and arithimetic operations of Magic-1, ALU operands will be the L and R bus and will post the results in the Z bus, the ALU can also work with 8/16 bits wich is controled by the "aluop_size" opcode bit.
Magic-1 ALU will handle the following operations:
    # Operation AND
    # Operation SUB
    # Operation ADD
    # Operation determined in IR(1..3)

The ALU card were made with 74F381 (ALU) chip wich has much more operations
